# Q-learning on Games of Imperfect Information
We applied Q-learning, the process of learning the value of state-action pairs, to games where the full state is not surfaced to the decision maker. Our full results are described [here](https://github.com/ryanholmdahl/qlearn/blob/master/Final_Project.pdf), but, in summary, we determined that a Q-learning agent could eventually understand the likelihood of various world states given the surfaced state and act accordingly.
