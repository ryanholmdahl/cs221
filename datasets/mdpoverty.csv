"a. Not all indicators were available for all countries; caution should thus be used in cross-country comparisons. Where data are missing, indicator weights are adjusted to total 100 percent.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b. The Multidimensional Poverty Index is based on a set of revised specifications of deprivations in three dimensions - health, education and living standards outlined in Technical note 5 at http://hdr.undp.org/en.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c. D indicates data are from Demographic and Health Surveys, M indicates data are from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, and N indicates data from national surveys. The list of surveys is given at http://hdr.undp.org. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DEFINITIONS ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Multidimensional Poverty Index: Percentage of the population that is multidimensionally poor adjusted by the intensity of the deprivations. See Technical note 5 (http://hdr.undp.org/en) for details on how the Multidimensional Poverty Index is calculated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Multidimensional poverty headcount: Percentage of the population with a weighted deprivation score of at least 33 percent. It is also expressed in thousands of the population in the survey year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Intensity of deprivation of multidimensional poverty: Average percentage of deprivation experienced by people in multidimensional poverty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Population near multidimensional poverty: Percentage of the population at risk of suffering multiple deprivations—that is, those with a deprivation score of 20–33 percent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Population in severe poverty: Percentage of the population in severe multidimensional poverty—that is, those with a deprivation score of 50 percent or more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Contribution of deprivation to overall poverty: Percentage of the Multidimensional Poverty Index attributed to deprivations in each dimension.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MAIN DATA SOURCES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Columns 1 and 2: Calculated from various household surveys, including ICF Macro Demographic and Health Surveys, United Nations Children's Fund Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys and several national household surveys conducted between 2005 and 2012.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Columns 3–10: HDRO calculations based on data on household deprivations in education, health and living standards from various household surveys listed in column 1 using the revised methodology described in Technical note 5 at http://hdr.undp.org/en.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
